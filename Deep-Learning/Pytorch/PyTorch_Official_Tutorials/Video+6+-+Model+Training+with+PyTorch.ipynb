    "* The mechanics of automated gradient computation, which is central to gradient-based model training\n",

    "* We'll discuss specific loss functions and when to use them\n",
    "* We'll look at PyTorch optimizers, which implement algorithms to adjust model weights based on the outcome of a loss function\n",

    "The `Dataset` is responsible for accessing and processing single instances of data.\n",

    "The `DataLoader` pulls instances of data from the `Dataset` (either automatically or with a sampler that you define), collects them in batches, and returns them for consumption by your training loop. The `DataLoader` works with all kinds of datasets, regardless of the type of data they contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll be using the Fashion-MNIST dataset provided by TorchVision. We use `torchvision.transforms.Normalize()` to zero-center and normalize the distribution of the image tile content, and download both training and validation data splits."
